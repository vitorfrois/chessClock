# Frois' Chess Clock

## About the project
This is a simple chess clock project, developed during the quarantine. Mainly inspired by https://github.com/naldin/ArduinoChessClock, from @naldin. 

I changed his code so I could use only three buttons (pause, black and white) to choose the most commom time setting in chess competitions and display the hours in the LCD screen.

## Features 
-Medium screen with big numbers

-3 strong button

-Most used FIDE time settings on setup

-Bonus time function
